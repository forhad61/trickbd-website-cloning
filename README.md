# 🤖 Simple Front-end Cloning with HTML, CSS & AI Chatbot 
This project creates an identical looking homepage/landing page of trickbd.com - a tech based site from Bangladesh. The site has simple design and easy to navigate layout which is ideal for such a project. 

Please note this project is for educational purpose only, and not meant to be any functional website. 

## 🎭 What is website cloning? 
I don't think you're here without understanding that question. If you don't, googling takes less than 5 seconds. 

## ✍🏻 Requirements 
For this project, you don't need to be a master of HTML & CSS. But you need the basic understandning of web dev to modify the code in need. You also need an AI chatbot which will make it possible after all. 

## ⚙ Process 
Devide the site by header, navigation, post sections and footer. Then ask your desired chatbot to create code for each section. The code won't be perfect, so you have to add/remove/change where necessary. I used Google Bard in this case. 

## 📑 Result 
The code is different. After all, trickbd is on wordpress, running PHP. I just wrote a few lines of HTML and CSS. The cloned webpage isn't perfect either. But it's possible to make it accurate by tweaking more. 

AI made it far easier to finish the project even though I am away from web development for more than 3 years. That's the point there - it makes your life easier. But if you fail to utilize this new magic, you're bound to get replaced by those machines! 

Happy cloning 🌺
